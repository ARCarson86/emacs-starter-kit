;; "Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
;; same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger
;; and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish."
;; -Neal Stephenson, "In the Beginning was the Command Line"

;; This file just brings together other pieces of the starter kit plus
;; user- and host-specific configs.
